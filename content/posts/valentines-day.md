Being a single i dont have anything to share except a story on Valentine's day
    
Many months ago, while i was getting myself cup of a coffee, there was this girl, whom i absolutly adored, wallked in there to get her own.
We never had any oppurtunity to speak to each other because she was always swarmed by other people and my awfull social skills.
One might say that this was my chance but being alone in the vicinity of her flared up butterflies in my stomach alongside weird muscle contractions.
I felt like i was going to throw up. Inspite of all that, I managed to say "hi" to her in a lost voice and then i turned toward 
to wastebin infront me for a precautionary measure incase i vommit. we stood there for a minute or two and then suddenly i heard a beep that my cup is ready. 
I was so nervous that i picked up my cup and ran away.

Happy valentines day!
