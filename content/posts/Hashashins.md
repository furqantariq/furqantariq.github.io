In the West, there exists a prevailing notion that Islam, just like their religion, concerns itself solely with ethics; 
beliefs; rituals, and prophecies, and it is going through some kind of “bad phase” or being misused. 
But I believe it is much more than that and deals with other aspects as well. In fact, the religious philosophies it has, 
are not that different from other Abrahamic religions.

Unlink other religions, most of the conflicts and sectarian divisions in Islam are not the result of theological differences 
but of real-world political and social crises (e.g. succession disputes, civil wars ..etc.). The martial elements it has 
is not just a “bug” but it is there by design. One might say that Islam is a religion that embodies these political, 
social, and cultural values but I think it is rather a socio-political framework that encompasses theological ideology.
