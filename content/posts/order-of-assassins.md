There exists a prevailing notion that Islam, similar to other religions, solely concerns itself with ethics, beliefs, 
rituals, and prophecies, and that it is going through some kind of 'bad phase' or being misused, which is not entirely false.
However, I believe Islam encompasses much more than that and addresses additional aspects. Although its religious philosophies 
are not significantly different from other Abrahamic religions, Islam intersects more extensively with the political and social realms.

Unlike its counterparts, most of the conflicts and sectarian divisions in Islam are not fueled by theological differences 
but by real-world political and social crises, such as power struggles, succession disputes, civil wars, and more.
The martial elements it possesses are not just a "bug" but they are there by design.

One could argue that Islam is a 
religion that embodies these political, social, and cultural values, but I consider it more as a socio-political framework 
that encompasses theological ideology.
