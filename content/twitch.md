I have a [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/amoebatron) channel where I occasionally stream my gameplay. Below are some highlights from my past streams.

## Trollpocalypse
We were minding our business when suddenly, we got ambushed by four [trolls](https://valheim.fandom.com/wiki/Troll) -- a miniboss in valheim, which is like, never happens. 
And then, out of nowhere, another [miniboss](https://valheim.fandom.com/wiki/Abomination) spawned and they started fighting each other. ðŸ˜‚
