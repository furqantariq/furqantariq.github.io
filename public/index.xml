      <description>Birthday Problem is one of those problem in probability that seem counterintuitive at first glance but is backed by elegant mathematical reasoning, proving it otherwise. It demonstrates that in a group of just 23 people, there&#39;s a 50% chance of at least two individuals sharing a birthday. At first glance, this result feels surprising. I have been part of numerous gatherings or groups with 23 or more people, yet I rarely encounter shared birthdays.</description>

      <description>Raycasting is a technique in Computer Graphics to create three-dimensional (3D) perspective image from two-dimensional (2D) data. Back in the days, when game development was in its nascency and computer were slow with limited memory, it was one of the efficient ways to create scenes from a player&amp;rsquo;s perspective. It gained prominence in games like Wolfenstein 3D and Doom which also happened to introduce the concept of first-person-shooter (FPS) games.</description>

      <description>Recently, I was playing around with flat assembler and i needed something to write in it. I tried &amp;ldquo;Hello world&amp;rdquo; program but it was not enough. I believe that generally &amp;ldquo;Hello world&amp;rdquo; programs are not a good way to learn about details of a programming language, especially for somewhat experienced programmers.&#xA;So I wrote a virus to familiarize myself to it. Because it is compact and has a everything from condition control flows to loop constructs, not just printing out in standard output and it only took me couple of hours to write it.</description>

      <title>Finding sum of even Fibonacci numbers</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the problem from Project Euler #2, which I have solved couple of years ago but never properly documented it. The problem states&#xA;Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, &amp;hellip; By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</description>

      <description>I have a Twitch channel where I occasionally stream my gameplay. Below are some highlights from my past streams.&#xA;Trollpocalypse We were minding our business when suddenly, we got ambushed by four trolls &amp;ndash; a miniboss in valheim, which is like, never happens. And then, out of nowhere, another miniboss spawned and they started fighting each other. ðŸ˜‚ Our Boat Didn&amp;rsquo;t Stand a Chance! Double Russian Mafia The Sniper Save </description>
