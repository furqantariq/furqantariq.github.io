      <description>Recently, I was playing around with flat assembler and i needed something to write in it. I tried &amp;ldquo;Hello world&amp;rdquo; program but it was not enough. I believe that generally &amp;ldquo;Hello world&amp;rdquo; programs are not a good way to learn about details of a programming language, especially for somewhat experienced programmers.&#xA;So I wrote a virus to familiarize myself to it. Because it is compact and has a everything from condition control flows to loop constructs, not just printing out in standard output and it only took me couple of hours to write it.</description>
