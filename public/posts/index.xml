      <description>Raycasting is a technique in Computer Graphics to create three-dimensional (3D) perspective image from two-dimensionsal (2D) data. Back in days, when gaming industry was in its nascency and computer were slow with limited memory, it was the efficient way to create scenes from player perspective. It gained prominence in games like Wolfenstein 3D and Doom which also happened to introduce the concept of first-person-shooter (FPS) games.
Before delving into implementation of raycasting engine, we have to define our game world data in 2D-matrix in which each element corresponds to square tile in the game world with certain height and width.</description>

      <description>Recently, I was playing around with flat assembler and i needed something to write in it. I tried &amp;ldquo;Hello world&amp;rdquo; program but it was not enough. I believe that generally &amp;ldquo;Hello world&amp;rdquo; programs are not a good way to learn about details of a programming language, especially for somewhat experienced programmers.
So I wrote a virus to familiarize myself to it. Because it is compact and has a everything from condition control flows to loop constructs, not just printing out in standard output and it only took me couple of hours to write it.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the problem from Project Euler #2, which I have solved couple of years ago but never properly documented it. The problem states
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, &amp;hellip; By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</description>
