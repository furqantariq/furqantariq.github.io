<p>I always tell people that Islam is a very different religion from others. Normally religions consisits of ethics, beliefs, rituals, prophecies and philosophies, but Islam ecompasses much more that and addresses additional aspects as well. Although its religious philosophies are not significantly different from other Abrahamic religions (especiialy judaism), but Islam intersects more extensively with the political and social realms.</p>
<p>Unlike its counterparts, in Islam most of the conflicts and sectarian divisions are not stem from theological differences
but from real-world political and social crises, such as power struggles, succession disputes, civil wars, and more.
The martial elements it possesses are not just a &ldquo;bug&rdquo; but they are there by design. I consider Islam more of a socio-political framework that embodies theological ideology rather than just a religion.</p>
